_A very interesting and valuable experience from Sanbercode bootcamp. I learnt a lot and it gave me a good grounding in the basics of React. It really made me think, and I also liked how it enabled me to interact with great people from the bootcamp. The assignments were corrected quickly, with lots of positive feedback from the tutors. Iâ€™m looking forward to follow up to the next advanced React course._
